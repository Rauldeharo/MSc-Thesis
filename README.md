# MSc-Thesis
This repository aims to share all the scripts used for the analysis of ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN data, with the final goal to benchmark a peak calling for CUT&amp;RUN.

This MSc project is in the framework of the study of transcriptional regulation, principal research of 3D Chromatin Organization group led by Dr. Javierre BM. [3D Chromatin Organization](https://www.carrerasresearch.org/es/organizaci%C3%B3n-3d-de-la-cromatina_78766)

## Peak-callers analyzed:

- [**MACS2** ](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS)

- [**SEACR**](https://github.com/FredHutch/SEACR)

Sequencing files were obtained from nB-cells using HiseqX platform on Macrogen Inc.
All reads processing steps were performed following the ENCODE standards, as it is described on [JavierreLab_liCHiC](https://github.com/JavierreLab/liCHiC/tree/main/3.ChIPseq%20Processing)
